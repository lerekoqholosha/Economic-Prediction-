Predicting Economic well being

. For this competition

we attempt to create a workaround for this lack of data by building a model able to predict a measure of wealth as measured in household surveys using readily available inputs.

Using data from 18 different countries collected at different times,

you must correctly predict the cluster-level estimated wealth measures found from surveys in 7 different countries not covered in the training data.

`A successful model could be useful for filling in the gaps between the more expensive surveys.`
